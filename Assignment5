For my 2D game, I chose the theme of a mouse trapped inside of a cave which is looking for cheese along with its way out.
This makes my game a maze game. 
For my character I have a mouse. For my background, I have a pattern that looks like insade of a cave.
The tool I used for this assignment was pixelart to draw all the game objects I needed. For example, the mouse, cheese, and background.
  
This is how I imported all of my game objects that I created in pixelart into unity:
1. Opened the "Assets" drop down menu at the top of the screen.
2. Then clicked on "Import New Asset".
3. Selected all my game objects that I wanted to import.
4. Then clicked "Import".

I faced one challenge which was creating the actual game objects like the cheese since it needed lots of detail to actually look like cheese. I solved this problem by looking at pixelated cheese art online, and looked at what they did to make it so good. Then I tried doing the same like adding darker spots on the side of the cheese than the top to give it more volume and to make it not look flat.
